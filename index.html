          Copenhagen Roller Derby was founded in September 2009 and is the oldest roller derby team in Denmark. We currently have around 80 members in the league. We are a member of WFTDA, and we play under the WFTDA gender policy. We have an A Team
          and B Team that both play internationally. We also have a Junior Roller Derby team - The Troublemakers.
